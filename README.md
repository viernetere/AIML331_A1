# **AIML331 ASSIGNMENT 1**

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of image processing and filtering methods for part 2 of the AIML331 assignment 1. 

## Problem Description
* Part 1: Sparse Keypoint Detection and Tracking (part1.py)
* Part 2: Dense Tracking Using Optical Flow (part2.py)
* Part 3: Application on Object Tracking (part3_SIFT.py, part3_OpticalFlow.py)
* Part 4: Advanced Challenge (part4.py)

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:
  * NumPy for mathematical calculation
  * PIL for loading the image
  * Matplotlib for visualisation purposes


## Usage
* Download the jupyter notebook (AIML331_A1.ipynb) and the checkerboard image (checkerboard.png)
* Ensure both files are in the same directory
* Run the jupyter notebook

## Development Notes
* I used generative AI (ChatGPT and Copilot) to implement some code in this assignment such as functions and computer vision problems
