# **AIML331 ASSIGNMENT 1**

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of image processing and filtering methods for part 2 of the AIML331 assignment 1. 

## Problem Description
* 2.1: Finding and converting a checkerboard image to grayscale
* 2.2: Generating the histogram and cumulative probability function of the image
* 2.3: Applying low-pass filter to the image within the spatial domain
* 2.4: Explanation of filter separability
* 2.5: Applying low-pass filter to the image within the frequency domain
* 2.6: Computing the histogram of the filtered image
* 2.7: Using cumulative distribution functions to achieve uniform intensity distribution

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Libraries:
- NumPy for mathematical calculation
- PIL for loading the image
- Matplotlib for visualisation purposes
* The jupyter notebook (AIML331_A1.ipynb)
* The checkerboard image (checkerboard.png)

## Usage
* Download the jupyter notebook (AIML331_A1.ipynb) and the checkerboard image (checkerboard.png)
* Ensure both files are in the same directory
* Run the jupyter notebook

## Development Notes
* I used generative AI (ChatGPT and Copilot) to implement some code in this assignment such as mathematical calculations and functions
